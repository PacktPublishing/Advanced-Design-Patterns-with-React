## About the Video Course
Taking a complete journey through the most valuable design patterns in React, this book demonstrates how to apply design patterns and best practices in real-life situations, on new or already existing projects. It will help you to make your applications more flexible, perform better, and easier to maintain, giving your workflow a huge boost when it comes to speed without reducing quality. We'll begin by understanding the internals of React before gradually moving on to create forms that actually work. Then we'll style React components and optimize them to make applications faster and more responsive. Finally, we'll write tests effectively and you'll learn how to contribute to React and its ecosystem. By the end of the video, you'll know how to avoid a lot of trial-and-error and developmental headaches, and you will be well on the road to becoming a React expert.
